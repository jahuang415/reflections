Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: To store your work so that if your local copy gets corrupted or lost, you won't lose your work. Also, if you want to be able to collaborate with others, you will need to set up the remote repository.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Pull may sync your repository before you're ready to do so. You may lose any commits or changes that you made that were uncommitted and lose them.
